## Common Patterns

The database schema follows several common patterns:

1. **Soft Deletion**: Most collections include `deleted` and `deletedAt` fields to support soft deletion.

2. **Audit Fields**: Most collections include creation and modification timestamps and user references.

3. **Versioning**: Many collections include a `__v` field for optimistic concurrency control.

4. **Embedded Documents**: Complex data structures are represented as embedded documents (e.g., Resources within Activities).

5. **Reference by ID**: Relationships between collections are established using ObjectId references.

6. **Status Flags**: Most collections include an `isActive` field to indicate current status.

7. **Serial Numbers**: Many collections include a `serial` field as a human-readable unique identifier.
